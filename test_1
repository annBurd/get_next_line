1. [Verse 1: James Hetfield]
2. So close no matter how far
3. Couldn't be much more from the heart
4. Forever trusting who we are
5. And nothing else matters
6.
7. Never opened myself this way
8. Life is ours, we live it our way
9. All these words I don't just say
10. And nothing else matters
11.
12. Trust I seek and I find in you
13. Everyday for us something new
14. Open mind for a different view
15. And nothing else matters
16.
17. [Chorus: James Hetfield]
18. Never cared for what they do
19. Never cared for what they know
20. But I know
21.
22. [Verse 2: James Hetfield]
23. So close no matter how far
24. It couldn't be much more from the heart
25. Forever trusting who we are
26. And nothing else matters
27.
28. [Chorus: James Hetfield]
29. Never cared for what they do
30. Never cared for what they know
31. But I know
32.

36. I never opened myself this way
37. Life is ours, we live it our way
38. All these words I don't just say
39. And nothing else matters
40.
41. Trust I seek and I find in you
42. Everyday for us something new
43. Open mind for a different view
44. And nothing else matters
45.
46. [Chorus: James Hetfield]
47. Never cared for what they say
48. Never cared for games they play
49. Never cared for what they do
50. Never cared for what they know
51. And I know, yeah
